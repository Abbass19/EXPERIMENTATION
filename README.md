# Experimentation and Knowledge  

This repository is more than code and experiments—it is a reflection of a journey sparked by curiosity, guided by logic, and shaped by a deep interest in the history of knowledge and mathematics. Each experiment here is an invitation to explore, question, and understand not just formulas or functions, but the process of thinking itself. Inspired by great minds who designed experiments to reach certainty, I approach each piece of work as a way to train reasoning, strengthen intuition, and sharpen problem-solving.  

The central theme of this series is simple: **through experimentation, we refine our understanding of the world and of ourselves.**

## 1. Lady Tasting Tea and Early Inspirations  

The book *Lady Tasting Tea* opened my eyes to the subtle beauty of experimental design and statistical thinking. Its stories of meticulous observation and rigorous testing revealed a culture of intellectual exploration that had long fascinated mathematicians and scientists. Reading this book sparked a series of ideas in my mind: how can curiosity, structured thought, and careful experimentation be applied beyond the lab?  

**Three-line insight:**  
Explores the subtleties of experimental design and statistical thinking.  
Shows how careful observation and rigorous testing reveal patterns and truths.  
Inspires applying structured curiosity beyond formal experiments.

## 4. Closing Notes  

This repository is not about reaching the “final answer.” It is about keeping the process of inquiry alive. Every experiment, every question, and every observation adds another layer to the journey of knowledge.  

Through **experimentation and knowledge**, we sharpen our ability to think, discover, and create.
